About the files in this directory 
-----------------------------------
This Test directory contains 2 test flows:
1. Basic tests - placed under the basicTest directory are stand alone tests that do not require any prerequisites besides having a test partner to run the test.
    These tests can be invoked manually and automatically with the following parameters:
           <DC URL>
           <parnter id> 
           <admin secret>
	       <user secret>
2. Advanced tests - placed under the advancedTests directory are tests that require prerequisites additional to a test partner to run the tests.
These prerequisites creation should be added to the initalization phase prior to invoking the tests (in the runAllTests.php file)

Each file is a standalone test that does not relay on any pre-condition and can be invoked manually
You can use specific partner for each tests if the test require specific configuration.
